- should I add an option to mark a horse as not being ridden?
    - would that be a training option with a fee of 0?

ERRORS
  ** add error boundary to app component

 refactor:
  - should some components be functional components?
  - should fetching happen just once

**Update Readme

**stretch goals: 
  - include ride update
  - provide option to go back to a previous date and update rides
