- should I add an option to mark a horse as not being ridden?
    - would that be a training option with a fee of 0?

ERRORS
  ** add error boundary to app component

RIDES

ADD HORSE
  * handle errors

OWNER STATEMENT ROUTE
- update to abstract event handling

 refactor:
  - should some components be functional components?

**Update Readme
